YOU SHOULD PRACTICE THESE;

// Functions of Blood
* Components:
* Transpoertation:
* Regulation:
* Protection:

// Blood Type (i.e #)
# ABO Blood Group System

* AB: Antigens (A and B antigens)
* O: Oligoclonal antigens (O antigen)
* A: A antigen (A antigen)
* B: B antigen (B antigen)

# Rh Factor Blood Group System

* Positive (Rh+): Rh antigens (RhD, RhE, RhT)
* Negative (Rh-): No Rh antigens (RhA, RhB, RhAB)

// Blood Disorders

* Anemia: Deficiency of red blood cells
* Thalassemia: Deficiency of thalassemia antigens
* Hemoglobinopathies: Deficiency of hemoglobin
* Hemophilia: Deficiency of red blood cells
* Platelet Disorders: Deficiency of platelets

// Blood Cell Types

* Red Blood Cells (RBCs): Absorb oxygen and maintain normal body temperature
* White Blood Cells (WBCs): Control inflammation and maintain body temperature
* Platelets: Maintain blood pressure and blood clotting function

// Blood Cell Counts

* RBCs: 4.5 to 5.5 million per cubic millimeter (mm��)
* WBCs: 100,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter (mm��)
* Platelets: 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter (mm��)

// Blood Pressure

* Systolic pressure: The force exerted by the heart on the walls of the arteries
* Diastolic pressure: The force exerted by the heart on the walls of the arteries during systole

// Blood Sugar Levels

* Hypoglycemia: Low blood sugar levels
* Hyperglycemia: High blood sugar levels

// Blood Pressure Management

* Diet: Control blood sugar levels and maintain a healthy weight
* Exercise: Increase heart rate, blood pressure, and blood flow
* Medication: Treat hypertension and other blood disorders
* Fluids: Manage fluid intake and balance blood sugar levels

// Blood Pressure Control Methods

* Diastole Stress Test (DST): Measure diastolic blood pressure
* Systole Stress Test (SST): Measure systolic blood pressure
* High Blood Pressure (HBPS): Monitor blood pressure and adjust medications as needed

// Blood Sugar Control Methods

* Fasting: Consume less than 300 mg of carbohydrates per day
* Hypoglycemia: Limit intake of sugar and avoid excessive alcohol consumption
* Hyperglycemia: Limit intake of sugar and avoid excessive alcohol consumption

// Blood Sugar Monitoring Methods

* Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): Monitor blood sugar levels continuously
* Continuous Insulin Monitoring (CIM): Monitor blood sugar levels and insulin levels continuously
* Self-Monitoring Devices: Use devices to monitor blood sugar levels and adjust medications as needed

// Blood Volume

* Blood volume: The amount of blood in the body
* Normal blood volume: Approximately 5.5 to 6.5 cubic millimeters (mm��) per cubic centimeter (cc) of body volume
* Increased blood volume: Increased blood volume due to chronic diseases, medications, or surgeries

// Blood Donation

* Blood donation: The process of transferring blood from one person to another
* Requirements: Age, sex, weight, blood type, and health status
* Risk factors: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain genetic conditions

// Blood Transfusion

* Blood transfusion: The process of transferring blood from one person to another
* Types of blood transfusion: Autologous (transfusing blood from the same blood type), allogeneic (transfusing blood from another blood type), and transplant (transfusing blood from another organ)
* Risk factors: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain genetic conditions

// Blood Transfusion Safety

* Blood transfusion safety: The process of ensuring the safety of blood transfusions
* Precautions: Wear protective clothing, avoid close contact with blood transfusion sites, and follow the instructions of the transfusing person

# Plasma (55%)
Liquid component, mostly water (90%), containing dissolved proteins, electrolytes, and nutrients.

# Formed Elements (45%)
    Red Blood Cells (RBCs) - Erythrocytes
~ Function: Transport oxygen (O2) from lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide (CO2) from tissues to lungs.
~ Contains hemoglobin for O2 transport.
    White Blood Cells (WBCs) - Leukocytes
~ Function: Immune response and protection against infections.
~ Types: Lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils.
    Platelets (Thrombocytes)
~Function: Blood clotting to prevent bleeding.
